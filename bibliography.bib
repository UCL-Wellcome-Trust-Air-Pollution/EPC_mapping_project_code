To answer this question, we use individual-level census data and create historical pollution patterns derived from the locations of 5,000 industrial chimneys and an atmospheric model. We show that this observation results from path-dependent neighborhood sorting that began during the Industrial Revolution, as prevailing winds blew pollution eastward. Past pollution explains up to 20\% of observed neighborhood segregation in 2011, even though coal pollution stopped in the 1970s. We develop a quantitative model to identify the role of neighborhood effects and relocation rigidities underlying this persistence.},

	abstract = {Owing to the extensive critique of food-crop-based biofuels, attention has turned toward second-generation wood-based biofuels. A question is therefore whether timber taken from the vast boreal forests on an increasing scale should serve as a source of wood-based biofuels and whether this will be effective climate policy. In a typical boreal forest, it takes 70–120 years before a stand of trees is mature. When this time lag and the dynamics of boreal forests more generally are taken into account, it follows that a high level of harvest means that the carbon stock in the forest stabilizes at a lower level. Therefore, wood harvesting is not a carbon-neutral activity. Through model simulations, it is estimated that an increased harvest of a boreal forest will create a biofuel carbon debt that takes 190–340 years to repay. The length of the payback time is sensitive to the type of fossil fuels that wood energy replaces},

	abstract = {Emissions from wood burning for heating in secondary homes or cabins is an important part in the development of high-resolution emissions in specific areas. Norway is used as case study as 20\% of the national wood consumption for heating occurs in cabins. Our study first shows a method to estimate emissions from cabins based on traffic data to derive cabin occupancy, which combined with heating need allows for the spatial and temporal distribution of emissions. The combination of residential ({RWC}) and cabin wood combustion ({CWC}) emissions shows large spatial and temporal differences, and a temporally “cabin population” can in areas be orders of magnitude larger than the registered population. While {RWC} emissions have been steadily reduced, {CWC} have kept relatively constant or even increased, which results in an increase in the cabin share to total heating emissions up to 25–35\%. When comparing with regional emission inventories, our study shows that the gradient between rural and urban areas is not well-represented in regional inventories, which resembles a population-based distribution and does not allocate emissions in cabin municipalities. {CWC} emissions may become an increasing environmental concern as higher densification trends in mountain areas are observed.},

	abstract = {Estimates of population air pollution exposure typically rely on the outdoor component only, and rarely account for populations spending the majority of their time indoors. Housing is an important modifier of air pollution exposure due to outdoor pollution infiltrating indoors, and the removal of indoor-sourced pollution through active or passive ventilation. Here, we describe the application of an indoor air pollution modelling tool to a spatially distributed housing stock model for England and Wales, developed from Energy Performance Certificate ({EPC}) data and containing information for approximately 11.5 million dwellings. First, we estimate indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios and total indoor concentrations of outdoor air pollution for {PM}2.5 and {NO}2 for all {EPC} dwellings in London. The potential to estimate concentration from both indoor and outdoor sources is then demonstrated by modelling indoor background {CO} levels for England and Wales pre- and post-energy efficient adaptation, including heating, cooking, and smoking as internal sources. In London, we predict a median I/O ratio of 0.60 (99\% {CIs}; 0.53–0.73) for outdoor {PM}2.5 and 0.41 (99\%{CIs}; 0.34–0.59) for outdoor {NO}2; Pearson correlation analysis indicates a greater spatial modification of {PM}2.5 exposure by housing (ρ = 0.81) than {NO}2 (ρ = 0.88). For the demonstrative {CO} model, concentrations ranged from 0.4–9.9 ppm (99\%{CIs})(median = 3.0 ppm) in kitchens and 0.3–25.6 ppm (median = 6.4 ppm) in living rooms. Clusters of elevated indoor concentration are found in urban areas due to higher outdoor concentrations and smaller dwellings with reduced ventilation potential, with an estimated 17.6\% increase in the number of living rooms and 63\% increase in the number of kitchens exceeding recommended exposure levels following retrofit without additional ventilation. The model has the potential to rapidly calculate indoor pollution exposure across large housing stocks and estimate changes to exposure under different pollution or housing policy scenarios.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.12.037},
	abstract = {Ahead of measures to incentivise wood heating, the current level of wood burning in London was assessed by two tracer methods; i) a six week campaign of daily measurements of levoglucosan along a 38 km transect across the city during winter 2010, ii) a three year (2009–2011) measurement programme of black carbon and particulate matter from wood burning using differential {IR} and {UV} absorption by Aethalometer. Mean winter levoglucosan concentrations were 160 ± 17 ng m−3 in central London and 30 ± 26 ng m−3 greater in the suburbs, with good temporal correlation (r2 = 0.68–0.98) between sampling sites. Sensitivity testing found that the aethalometer wood burning tracer method was more sensitive to the assumed value of the Ångström coefficient for fossil fuel black carbon than it was to the Ångström coefficient for wood burning {PM}, and that the model was optimised with Ångström coefficient for fossil fuel black carbon of 0.96. The aethalometer and levoglucosan estimates of mean {PM} from wood burning were in good agreement during the winter campaign; 1.8 μg m−3 (levoglucosan) and 2.0 μg m−3 (aethalometer); i.e. between 7\% and 9\% of mean {PM}10 across the London transect. Analysis of wood burning tracers with respect to wind speed suggested that wood burning {PM} was dominated by sources within the city. Concentrations of aethalometer and levoglucosan wood burning tracers were a greatest at weekends suggesting discretionary or secondary domestic wood burning rather than wood being used as a main heating source. Aethalometer wood burning tracers suggests that the annual mean concentration of {PM}10 from wood burning was 1.1 μg m−3. To put this in a policy context, this {PM}10 from wood burning is considerably greater than the city-wide mean {PM}10 reduction of 0.17 μg m−3 predicted from the first two phases of the London Low Emission Zone which was introduced to reduce {PM} from traffic sources.},
