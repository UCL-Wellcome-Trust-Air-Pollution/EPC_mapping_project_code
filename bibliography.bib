	abstract = {Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) has been identified as a major global health concern; however, the importance of specific chemical PM components remains uncertain. Recent studies have suggested that carbonaceous aerosols are important detrimental components of the particle mixture. Using time-series methods, we investigated associations between short-term exposure to carbonaceous particles and mortality in London, UK. Daily counts of non-accidental, respiratory, and cardiovascular deaths were obtained between 2010 and 2019. For the same period, daily concentrations of carbonaceous particles: organic (OC), elemental (EC), wood-burning (WC), total carbon (TC) and equivalent black carbon (eBC) were sourced from two centrally located monitoring sites (one urban-traffic and one urban-background). Generalized additive models were used to estimate the percentage change in mortality risk associated with interquartile range increases in particulate concentrations. Lagged effects up to 3 days were examined. Stratified analyses were conducted by age, sex, and season, separate analyses were also performed by site-type. For non-accidental mortality, positive associations were observed for all particle species at lag1, including statistically significant percentage risk changes in WC (0.51\% (95\%CI: 0.19\%, 0.82\%) per IQR (0.68 μg/m3)) and OC (0.45\% (95\%CI: 0.04\%, 0.87\% per IQR (2.36 μg/m3)). For respiratory deaths, associations were greatest for particulate concentrations averaged over the current and previous 3 days, with increases in risk of 1.70\% (95\%CI: 0.64\%, 2.77\%) for WC and 1.31\% (95\%CI: −0.08\%, 2.71\%) for OC. No associations were found with cardiovascular mortality. Results were robust to adjustment for particle mass concentrations. Stratified analyses suggested particulate effects were greatest in the summer and respiratory associations more pronounced in females. Our findings are supportive of an association between carbonaceous particles and non-accidental and respiratory mortality. The strongest evidence of an effect was for WC; this is of significance given the rising popularity of wood-burning for residential space heating and energy production across Europe.},

	abstract = {Introduction
: There are reports that lung cancer in non-smokers (LCINS) is increasing in the United Kingdom (UK) and other high-income countries but evidence from large-scale cohort studies to support this claim is limited.
Material and methods
: Using The Health Improvement Network (THIN) IQVIA™ Medical Research Data, we identified a cohort of 3,679,831 people from the UK self-reporting to their primary care physician as never or non-smokers. We estimated age-adjusted incidence rates for recorded lung cancer before (1998−2007) and after (2008−2018) the introduction of smoke-free legislation using multivariable Poisson regression. We also explored the impact of geographic location, social deprivation and urbanicity.
Results
: The analysis included 3,212 lung cancer events and 28 million person-years (PYs). Between 1998 and 2007, the age-adjusted rates in men declined by 9\% per year (95 \%CI: 7–11\%) from an estimated 5.6 to 1.5 per 10,000 PYs and by 3\% per year (95 \%CI: 1–5\%) between 2008 and 2018. These trends for men were similar across sociodemographic strata. Between 1998 and 2007, age-adjusted rates were stable for women at 1.5 per 10,000 PYs. However, there was evidence that time trends for women differed depending on levels of social deprivation with rates increasing by 5\% per year (95 \%CI: 2–9\%) from an estimated 1.3–2.1 per 10,000 PYs for women living in the least socially deprived areas. Sex-specific time trends from 2008 to 2016 were broadly similar in a separate cohort of self-reported never smokers from UK Biobank with cancer events linked to national registries.
Conclusion
In summary, the incidence of LCINS has reduced or remained stable for most of the UK with the possible exception of women living in the least socially deprived areas.},

	abstract = {Ahead of measures to incentivise wood heating, the current level of wood burning in London was assessed by two tracer methods; i) a six week campaign of daily measurements of levoglucosan along a 38 km transect across the city during winter 2010, ii) a three year (2009–2011) measurement programme of black carbon and particulate matter from wood burning using differential IR and UV absorption by Aethalometer. Mean winter levoglucosan concentrations were 160 ± 17 ng m−3 in central London and 30 ± 26 ng m−3 greater in the suburbs, with good temporal correlation (r2 = 0.68–0.98) between sampling sites. Sensitivity testing found that the aethalometer wood burning tracer method was more sensitive to the assumed value of the Ångström coefficient for fossil fuel black carbon than it was to the Ångström coefficient for wood burning PM, and that the model was optimised with Ångström coefficient for fossil fuel black carbon of 0.96. The aethalometer and levoglucosan estimates of mean PM from wood burning were in good agreement during the winter campaign; 1.8 μg m−3 (levoglucosan) and 2.0 μg m−3 (aethalometer); i.e. between 7\% and 9\% of mean PM10 across the London transect. Analysis of wood burning tracers with respect to wind speed suggested that wood burning PM was dominated by sources within the city. Concentrations of aethalometer and levoglucosan wood burning tracers were a greatest at weekends suggesting discretionary or secondary domestic wood burning rather than wood being used as a main heating source. Aethalometer wood burning tracers suggests that the annual mean concentration of PM10 from wood burning was 1.1 μg m−3. To put this in a policy context, this PM10 from wood burning is considerably greater than the city-wide mean PM10 reduction of 0.17 μg m−3 predicted from the first two phases of the London Low Emission Zone which was introduced to reduce PM from traffic sources.},
